"Hack Quarantine" hack

This project uses Flask to host a web app.
To get it fully working, you will need a google maps api account, twilio account, and mysql database.
To set up google maps api, put your key where the api is referenced in the mappage.html file.
To set up twilio, put your account information in the app.py file.
You should also edit the message that twilio sends, specifically the url to your site.
To set up mysql, after creating a mysql database, put the information corresponding to that database in your app.py file.
